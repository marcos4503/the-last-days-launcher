1. Set up an instance of Minecraft The Last Days using the game, as you would normally set up the game.
2. Using a tool like "https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/", compare the differences between the
   "options.txt" in this folder and the "options.txt" of your configured game. Copy the "options.txt" values
   from your game to the "options.txt" file in this folder, for each setting you changed in the game.
3. Update the file "options-to-apply-in-clients.ini" to inform the name of the options contained in "options.txt"
   that should be applied to the players game.
4. The Launcher will download this file and copy the options of relevancy/interest to the Minecraft of players.
