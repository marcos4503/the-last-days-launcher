1. Using 7-Zip, compact all the content of a The Last Days Server, but splitting into pieces of 15MB. DO NOT include the "world" and
   "!Server-Panel" folders.
   The name of the parts must be like "current-server-data.zip.XXX"
2. Copy all parts to the folder "Repository-Pages/builded-ready-server-data"
3. Update the file "current-server-data-info.json" to have the links for each part of the server data ZIP files.
4. The "The Last Days Server Panel" application will download this server data if the user runs the Panel without having server data.
