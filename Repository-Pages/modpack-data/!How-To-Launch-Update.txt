1. Copy all folders and file relevant for the The Last Days modpack, of a Minecraft instance of The Last Days, to a folder of computer
   Example of relevant files/folders: "mods", "config", "resourcepacks", "texturepacks", etc...
   (These files that will be copied will be the modpack files, which will be added to the game data (Prism Launcher + Minecraft The Last Days instance)
   base that was downloaded to the user's computer. Therefore, these files can only be things like mods, mod configurations, resource packs, etc. 
   They will be installed inside the ".minecraft" folder of the "The Last Days" instance on the players computers.)
2. Using 7-Zip, compact all the files/folders that you have copied, but splitting into pieces of 10MB
   The name of the parts must be like "current-modpack-data.zip.XXX"
3. Copy all parts to the folder "Repository-Pages/modpack-data"
4. Update the file "current-modpack-info.json" to have the current version of modpack data available for download in this repository
5. The Launcher will download these data and apply on The Last Days Minecraft instance of the players, replacing the old files by these files
